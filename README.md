# **Defense-Grade Security System**

## Project Overview

The **Defense-Grade Security System** is a next-generation, high-assurance platform designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of mission-critical data in defense and national security applications. Built with cutting-edge cryptographic protocols, multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure key management, and quantum-resistant algorithms, this system ensures robust protection against modern and emerging threats, including quantum computing attacks. Designed for extreme environments and highly regulated sectors, this system integrates seamlessly with existing Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, and can be customized to meet various operational security levels.

The system is built on **Rust**, ensuring performance, safety, and concurrency.

## Key Features

### **1. Multi-Layered Zero-Knowledge Authentication and Authorization**
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Authenticate users without revealing any sensitive information.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Use OAuth 2.0/JWT for role-based access control with added security layers.
- **Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access permissions dynamically adjusted based on user roles and security levels.

### **2. Advanced Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**
- **Hybrid Cryptographic Schemes**: Leverage a combination of classical (AES-256-GCM) and quantum-resistant (FrodoKEM) algorithms to mitigate risks posed by quantum computers.
- **Post-Quantum Key Exchange**: Utilize quantum-safe key exchange mechanisms during TLS handshakes to future-proof the communication channel.

### **3. Secure Key Management with Hardware Security Module (HSM)**
- **HSM Integration**: FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified HSMs to store and retrieve cryptographic keys with secure key derivation.
- **Automatic Key Rotation**: Periodic key rotation policies managed through HSM to prevent key reuse and reduce risks.
- **Tamper-Proof Key Generation**: Utilize secure HSM-based random number generators (RNG) to generate cryptographically strong keys.

### **4. Encrypted and Authenticated Communication**
- **AES-256-GCM with GCM Authentication Tags**: Encrypted and authenticated data with forward secrecy.
- **End-to-End Encryption via TLS 1.3**: Ensures data protection over untrusted networks with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

### **5. Continuous Monitoring and Real-Time Anomaly Detection**
- **SIEM Integration**: Real-time data feeds into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools for proactive threat detection.
- **Machine Learning-Driven Anomaly Detection**: Continuous monitoring with behavior-based analytics to identify potential threats or unusual activities.
- **Audit Trails**: Detailed logging of all operations for post-incident forensic analysis.

### **6. Comprehensive Security Audits and Penetration Testing**
- **Automated Security Audits**: Perform regular compliance checks, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to ensure system hardening.
- **Self-Remediation Mechanisms**: Detect and self-remediate vulnerabilities, if applicable.

### **7. Flexible Security Configuration and Multi-Level Operation Modes**
- **Dynamic Security Levels**: Configure multiple security levels based on operational requirements (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
- **Secure Transmission and Reception**: Protect data at rest, in transit, and in use with advanced cryptographic techniques.
- **Seamless Recovery Protocols**: Ensure data integrity with integrated backup and disaster recovery plans.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following components installed before setting up the project:

- **Rust (Nightly)**: Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  rustup install nightly
  rustup default nightly
  ```
- **HSM**: Configure an FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified HSM for key storage.
- **OAuth 2.0/JWT Provider**: Set up an OAuth 2.0 or JWT provider for MFA and access control.
- **TLS 1.3 Server**: Ensure the target server supports TLS 1.3 for secure communications.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/defense-security-system.git
   cd defense-security-system
   ```

2. **Configure Dependencies**:  
   Edit `Cargo.toml` to ensure all necessary crates are included:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   aes-gcm = "0.9.0"
   pqcrypto = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["frodokem"] }
   rand = "0.8.5"
   tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
   hmac = "0.12.1"
   sha2 = "0.10.2"
   rustls = "0.20.1"
   oauth2 = "4.0.0-beta.3"
   serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
   serde_json = "1.0.72"
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Usage

### Example Workflow

**Scenario**: A defense contractor needs to securely transmit mission-critical data between **Alice** (a field agent) and **Bob** (a central command analyst). This workflow ensures the highest security for transmission:

1. **Authentication with MFA**: Alice authenticates with MFA using her **OAuth 2.0** credentials.
   ```bash
   cargo run -- mfa-auth --user alice --role field-agent
   ```

2. **Encrypt Data**: Alice encrypts her mission-critical report using AES-256-GCM and quantum-resistant algorithms.
   ```bash
   cargo run -- encrypt --input "mission_report.txt" --output "encrypted_data.txt" --security-level high
   ```

3. **Transmit Data**: Alice securely transmits the encrypted file over a TLS 1.3 secured channel to Bob at command center.
   ```bash
   cargo run -- transmit --file "encrypted_data.txt" --to "bob@command-center"
   ```

4. **Decrypt and Verify**: Bob receives the file, decrypts it, and verifies the integrity of the data using quantum-resistant key exchanges.
   ```bash
   cargo run -- decrypt --input "encrypted_data.txt" --output "decrypted_report.txt" --user bob
   ```

### Example Commands

- **Encrypt File**:
  ```bash
  cargo run -- encrypt --input "sensitive_data.txt" --output "encrypted_data.bin" --mfa-token "123456"
  ```
- **Decrypt File**:
  ```bash
  cargo run -- decrypt --input "encrypted_data.bin" --output "decrypted_data.txt" --mfa-token "654321"
  ```
- **Monitoring & Detection**:
  ```bash
  cargo run -- monitor --security-level high --anomaly-detection
  ```

### Environment Variables

The system is highly configurable via environment variables:

| Variable                | Description                                                 |
